# hyper-GAE
 Tensorflow implementation of paper "Learning Unified Hyper-network for Multi-modal MR Image Synthesis and Tumor Segmentation with Missing Modalities"

 Code will be published recently.


## Overview


## Requirements
All experiments utilize the TensorFlow library. We recommend the following package versions:
* python == 3.6
* tensorflow-gpu == 1.10.0
* numpy == 1.19.2
* imageio == 2.9.0
* nibabel == 3.2.1


## Dataset
We use the MICCAI 2019 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS 2019) and MICCAI 2018 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS 2018) datasets in our experiments. The homepages of these two datasets are:<br>
* [BraTS 2019 dataset](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats-2019/)
* [BraTS 2018 dataset](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018.html)
